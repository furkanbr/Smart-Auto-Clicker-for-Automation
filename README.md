# Smart-Auto-Clicker-for-Automation

This Auto Clicker project made for automating long processes that repeat itself. It uses pictures to locate objects (for example buttons) and with few more method it can make whole process by itself.

I added few security functions to code for to not make any mistake while interacting with another program.

Anyone can change "orders" dictionary to automate any process by pictures, coordinates by pixels, sleep times or more advance methods like WaitUntillAppear or WaitUntillGone than can search for an image on the screen for doing certain order.

At next versions I will add UI to be able to use easily by everyone.
